# DankDataDivinations
A quick little data science project to find an appropriate strand of cannabis to map to the minor arcana in tarot. This is for a tarot deck I am creating with twi.

## The dataset
[Cannabis Species EDA and Models Pipeline](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kabure/cannabis-species-eda-and-models-pipeline)

## tldr:
with twi's help, we assigned each tarot card to 2 effects and 1 flavor - options came from the dataset. these mappings can be found in [tarot.csv](.\input\tarot.csv)

with this information, we found the best associated strains for each card. we changed the combinations of effects and flavors until we were happy with each combination. here is the resulting list.
